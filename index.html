                <p>I am originally from <em>Milwaukee Wisconsin</em> where I was born and raised. I moved to Portland Oregon in 2016, after I graduated from Cardinal Strich University with a BA in Business. I visited Portland the summer before I graduated and fell in love with the city. What caught my attention was the easy access to the surrounding nature.  I get the benefits of living in a city but also have the pleasure of hiking snowboarding, and surfing.</p>

              	<p>My decision to enroll in <span class= "ep">Epicodus</span> was my interest in programming.  I started hearing about coding boot camps while I was in college.  I decided to take a html course on Codecademy.  It sparked my interest and I enjoyed the idea of learning a new skill. After moving to Portland I had a hard time finding in a job in my field of study so I looked in to coding boot camps. <span class = "ep">Epicodus</span> had the best reviews in the country and happened to be fifteen minutes from my house. I decided to enroll and have not looked back.
